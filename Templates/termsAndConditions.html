                                            agreements act as a legal contract between you (the company) who has
                                            the website or mobile app and the user who access your website and
                                        mobile app.</p>

                                        <p>Having a Terms and Conditions agreement is completely optional. No
                                            laws require you to have one. Not even the super-strict and
                                            wide-reaching General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

                                        <p>It's up to you to set the rules and guidelines that the user must
                                            agree to. You can think of your Terms and Conditions agreement as
                                            the legal agreement where you maintain your rights to exclude
                                            users from your app in the event that they abuse your app, where you
                                            maintain your legal rights against potential app abusers, and so
                                            on.</p>
